/*
  "Download for offline" (#offlineBtn, songs.md): registers the service
  worker (see sw.js), then works through the whole library in three passes —
  every song/setlist/tour-copy file, then a full-range render of every
  curated Mixer instrument (lib/gm-voices.js's GM_VOICES) against the
  currently-selected soundfont set — reporting progress into #offlineStatus
  as it goes.

  Feature-detected: on a browser with no serviceWorker support (or none for
  module workers specifically — sw.js is a real ES module), #offlineBtn
  simply doesn't do anything meaningful to warm, and says so, rather than
  pretending it worked.

  runDownload() catches its own expected failure points (an unreachable
  index, a missing individual file) and turns each into a status message
  rather than a rejection — but downloadForOffline() still catches here too,
  as a last resort: an uncaught rejection reaching this click handler would
  otherwise leave "Getting ready…" stuck on screen with no way to tell
  what happened, on top of the unhandled-rejection console noise.

  The button is also the page's one PWA install affordance. A browser that
  judges this page installable (served over HTTPS, a valid manifest with
  icons and `display: standalone`, a registered service worker — every one
  of which this page already satisfies) signals that by firing
  `beforeinstallprompt` on `window`, once, at a moment of its own choosing —
  normally to show its own small "install"/"add to home screen" affordance
  (an address-bar icon, a mini-infobar) with no explanation of what it's
  for. `event.preventDefault()` suppresses that and stashes the event
  instead, so the same click that starts a download can also raise the
  browser's real, native install dialog — one control, one explanation
  ("Install app & download for offline"), rather than a second icon most
  visitors would never notice or understand. The captured event can only
  ever be prompted once (a second `.prompt()` call throws), so it's cleared
  immediately before calling it — a second click right after the visitor
  dismisses the native dialog falls straight through to a plain download
  instead of erroring on a spent event. Downloading proceeds either way
  (installed or not: accepting, dismissing and "not installable here" all
  look the same from here on) — the library is worth having offline whether
  or not the visitor chose to install. Not every browser ever fires this
  event at all (Firefox desktop doesn't implement it; iOS/iPadOS Safari has
  no programmatic install prompt — installing there is a manual "Add to
  Home Screen" from the share sheet) — on those the button quietly stays a
  plain download action, since there's nothing here to offer beyond what's
  already true.
