The **Red Jackets Jazzband** is a streetparade jazz band originating from Bergen op Zoom the Netherlands. We make jazz music were it is supposed to be, on the streets, between the people. We love to play at Jazz festivals teaching all generations about the timeless energy of traditional jazz music. Because we are commited into spreading the joy of jazz, we share [our music](/songs) for other musicians to enjoy. 

If you would like to see us in action, take a look at our [agenda](/agenda) or our [in action](/in-action) page.
